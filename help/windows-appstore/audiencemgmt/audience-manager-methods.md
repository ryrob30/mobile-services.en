# Audience Manager methods {#audience-manager-methods}

List of Audience Manager methods provided by the Windows 8.1 Universal App Store library.

The SDK currently has support for multiple [!DNL Adobe Experience Cloud Solutions], including [!DNL Analytics], [!DNL Target], and [!DNL Audience Manager]. Methods are prefixed according to the solution. Audience Manager methods are prefixed with "AudienceManager."

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you consume winmd methods from winJS (JavaScript), all methods automatically have their first letter lowercased.

If audience manager is configured in your JSON file, a signal containing lifecycle metrics is sent in with your lifecycle hit. 

* **GetVisitorProfile (winJS: getVisitorProfile)**

  Returns the visitor profile that was most recently obtained. Returns `null` if no signal has been submitted yet. Visitor profile is saved in `SharedPreferences` for easy access across multiple launches of your app. 

  * Here is the syntax for this method:

    ```csharp
    static fWindows::Foundation::Collections::IMap<Platform::String^, Platform::Object^> ^GetVisitorProfile();
    ```

  * Here is the code sample for this method:

    ```js
    var ADB = ADBMobile; 
    var profile = ADB.AudienceManager.getVisitorProfile();
     ```

* **GetDpid (winJS: getDpid)**

  Returns the current DPID.

  * Here is the syntax for this method:

    ```csharp
    static Platform::String ^GetDpid();
    ```

  * Here is the code sample for this method:

    ```js
    var ADB = ADBMobile; 
    var dpid = ADB.AudienceManager.getDpid();
    ```

* **GetDpuuid (winJS: getDpuuid)**

  Returns the current DPUUID. 

  * Here is the syntax for this method:

    ```csharp
    static Platform::String ^GetDpuuid();
    ```

  * Here is the code sample for this method:

    ```js
    var ADB = ADBMobile; 
    var dpuuid = ADB.AudienceManager.getDpuuid();
    ```

* **SetDpidAndDpuuid (winJS: setDpidAndDpuuid)**

  Sets the DPID and DPUUID. If DPID and DPUUID are set, they will be sent with each signal. 

  * Here is the syntax for this method:

    ```csharp
    static void SetDpidAndDpuuid(Platform::String ^dpid, Platform::String ^dpuuid); 
    ```

  * Here is the code sample for this method:

    ```js
    var ADB = ADBMobile; 
    ADB.AudienceManager.setDpidAndDpuuid("newDpid", "newDpuuid");
    ```

* **SignalWithData (winJS: signalWithData)**

  Sends Audience Manager a signal with traits and get the matching segments returned in a block callback. 

  * Here is the syntax for this method:

    ```csharp
    static Windows::Foundation::IAsyncOperation<Windows::Foundation::Collections::IMap<Platform::String^, Platform::Object> > ^SignalWithData(Windows::Foundation::Collections::IMap<Platform::String^, Platform::Object^> ^data);
    ```

  * Here is the code sample for this method:

    ```js
    var ADB = ADBMobile; 
    var traits = new Windows.Foundation.Collections.PropertySet(); 
    traits["trait"] = "b"; 
    ADB.AudienceManager.signalWithData(traits).then(function(visitorProfile) { 
      // segments come back here in "visitorProfile", normally found in the "segs" object of your json 
    }); 
    ```
