Marketers can create, save, and edit link destinations, such as Web, Deep, or other links, that can be used while building trackable Marketing Links.

To create different types of link destinations, see [Create and manage link destinations](/help/using/acquisition-main/c-manage-link-destinations/c-manage-link-destinations.md).

You can create the following types of link destinations:

* **[!UICONTROL App Deep Link]**

  App deep link destinations are URI schema deep links that direct users to a Deep Link in your app. For example, you can direct users to a product line in an online retailer's mobile app.

* **[!UICONTROL Web Link]**

    Web link destinations direct users to a specific URL. For example, you can direct users to a product line on an online retailer's website.  

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    >Web link destinations are **not** tracked.

* **[!UICONTROL Hybrid Link]**

    Hybrid links support iOS Universal Links or Android App Links.

For more information about how to create each type of link, see [Create new link destination](/help/using/acquisition-main/c-manage-link-destinations/t-create-new-app-deep-link-destination.md).
