# Create an Acquisition Link{#create-an-acquisition-link}

You can create app store links that let you download applications directly from the Apple App Store and Google Play. The links you create let you attribute your success events to the downloads.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Acquisition Links]** > **[!UICONTROL Create New]**.
1. Type the following information in the **[!UICONTROL Link Information]** section:

    * **[!UICONTROL Name]**
   (Required) Specify a descriptive name for the app link.
    * **[!UICONTROL Tracking Code]**
      Specify the desired tracking code or click **[!UICONTROL Generate]** to create a new tracking code.
    * **[!UICONTROL Source]**
      (Required) Specify the original referrer, such as "newsletter" or "homepage."
    * **[!UICONTROL Medium]**
      Specify the marketing medium, such as "banner" or "email."
    * **[!UICONTROL Content]**
      Specify the name or ID of the ad with the link.
    * **[!UICONTROL Term]**
      Specify paid terms or other search terms for the ad.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >The values in the above fields cannot be changed after the acquisition link is created.

1. Type information in the fields in the **[!UICONTROL Add App Store Link]** section.

   * **[!UICONTROL App Store]**
   Select the desired app store:  
      * Apple App Store  
      * Google Play  
   The options for each app store vary, as described below.
   * **[!UICONTROL Browser Region (Apple App Store Only)]**
      Specify a specific regional app store for desktop browsers. This setting lets you define the region-specific app store that you want an acquisition link to direct to when a user clicks the link from a desktop browser. Mobile devices auto-redirect based on device settings.
   * **[!UICONTROL Browser Language (Google Language (Google Play Only))]**
      Select a language from the drop-down list. This setting lets you define a specific language to display in the Google Play Store for desktop browsers. Mobile devices show language based on device settings.
   * **[!UICONTROL Search by Name ]**
     * For the Apple App Store, if you do not already know the App ID, you can search for the app by its name. You can limit your search by selecting an optional region from the **[!UICONTROL In Region]** drop-down list.
     * For Google Play, if you do not already know the Package Name, you can search for the app name by its name.
   * **[!UICONTROL App ID (Apple App Store only)]**
      If you searched for the app, this field is completed automatically. You can type the App ID value directly, rather than searching for the app.
   * **[!UICONTROL Package Name (Google Play only) ]**
      If you searched for the app, this field is completed automatically. You can type the Package Name value directly, rather than searching for the app.
