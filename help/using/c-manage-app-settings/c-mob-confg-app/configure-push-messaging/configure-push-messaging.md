# Configure push messaging{#configure-push-messaging}

You can use this information to help you configure the Push Services options on the Manage App Settings page when creating a new app or editing an existing app.

Before you configure push messaging, complete the prerequisite tasks in [Prerequisites to Enable Push Messaging](/help/using/c-manage-app-settings/c-mob-confg-app/configure-push-messaging/prerequisites-push-messaging.md).

* **Report Suite Considerations**

    You can configure one app store app for Apple and one for Google in each report suite. If you need additional apps, for example, one for a production environment and one for a dev environment, set up a new app store app and a new report suite for each environment.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Moving your app to a new report suite is not supported. If you migrate to a new report suite, your push configuration can break, and messages might not be sent.

1. Type information in the following fields under **[!UICONTROL Push Services]**:

    * Apple

      **[!UICONTROL Private Key]**

      Browse to and select your valid private key `.p12`, `.key`, or `.pen`.

      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >If the file that you select for the **[!UICONTROL Private Key]** input also contains a certificate, you do not need to specify the certificate.

    * **[!UICONTROL Certificate]**

      Specify a valid certificate. This option is required only when the **[!UICONTROL Private Key]** input does **not** contain a certificate. For more information about obtaining the SSL certificate and private key, see [Configure App to use APNS or FCM](/help/using/c-manage-app-settings/c-mob-confg-app/configure-push-messaging/configure-app-apns-gcm.md).

    * Google

      **[!UICONTROL API Key]**
      
      Specify a valid API key. For more information about obtaining the API key, see [Configure App to use APNS or FCM](/help/using/c-manage-app-settings/c-mob-confg-app/configure-push-messaging/configure-app-apns-gcm.md).

      For more information, see the following topics:

      * [Push Messaging in iOS](/help/ios/messaging-main/push-messaging/push-messaging.md)
