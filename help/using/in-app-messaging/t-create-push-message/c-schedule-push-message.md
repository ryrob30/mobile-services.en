# Schedule: Push Message{#schedule-push-message}

In the Adobe Mobile Services UI, you can schedule a push message to be delivered immediately, to be delivered later, and as a recurring event. These events can be scheduled on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

>[!TIP]
>
>Users can modify the scheduling settings for a push message job at any time. If there is no applicable date to send a recurring scheduled message, for example, a monthly recurring job every 31st day, on February 31st, or the 5th Tuesday of the month, no message is sent.

Remember the following information:

* The correct date and time format is `hh:mm` and `mm/dd/yyyy`. 

* You can edit a scheduled message in the following ways:

    * Can change the date to a later date. 
    * Change the repeat interval to another interval.

      For example, if you originally had a message that was sent every day, you can switch the recurrence to weekly.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>You **must** understand the following information before scheduling recurring push messages: 
>
>* The options that are displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Repeat]** drop-down list depend on the date you typed or selected. 
>
>  For example, if you typed `Saturday, October 7`, the following options are displayed: 
>
>    * **[!UICONTROL Never]** 
>    * **[!UICONTROL Every day]** 
>    * **[!UICONTROL Every Saturday]** 
>    * **[!UICONTROL Day 7 of Every Month]** 
>    * **[!UICONTROL 1st Saturday of Every Month]** 
>
>* Push messages are scheduled and sent based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). 
>
>  For example, if you scheduled a recurring message to be sent every Saturday at 12:00 pm (noon) **PST**, starting on October 7, the message will actually be sent on Saturday at 7 pm **GMT**. 
>* Messages are sent differently depending on whether you are located in the U.S., Europe, or Asia. 
>
>  For example, if you are located in San Jose, California, and you schedule a message to be sent on ***October 31*** at 5:30 pm **PST**, the message is actually sent on ***November 1*** at 12:30 am **GMT**. If you are located in Tokyo, and you schedule a message to be sent on ***January 1*** at 5:30 am, it will be sent on ***December 31*** at 8:30 pm **GMT**. 
>* Push messages are sent an hour earlier or later depending on when day light savings occurs. 
>* When you look at your push messages report, the message is displayed in the local time zone of your system. 
>
>  For example, if your start time is 12:00 pm **PST**, although the message will be sent at 7pm **GMT**, the message report will display the time sent as 12:00 pm **PST**.
