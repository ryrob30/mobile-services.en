# Map {#map}

You can view an interactive map that displays your POI and other data markers.

 ![](assets/map.png)

Here is some important information to remember:

* You can increase or decrease the size of the map.

  This feature is useful, for example, if you have two points of interest that are close together. Enlarging the map lets you view it in greater detail.
* Your points of interest display in blue.

  Other data markers, such as Launches, display in black. Click a marker to view more information.
