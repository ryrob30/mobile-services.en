# Apple TV Implementation with tvOS {#apple-tv-implementation-with-tvos}

This information helps you implement Apple TV with tvOS.

With Apple TV, you can now create applications to run in the native tvOS environment. You can create a native app by using several frameworks in iOS, or you can create your app by using XML templates and JavaScript.

>[!TIP]
>
>tvOS support is available starting in `AdobeMobileLibrary` version 4.7.0.

## Getting Started {#section_CAB40A5B5FC745068C8A5DF8F9AB6199}

>[!TIP]
>
>We assume that your project has a target that is an Apple TV app that is targeting tvOS. For more information, see [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/tvos/documentation/).

## Configuring a Native App for tvOS {#section_5095F19B3C4545F68E8C1E37A7E303AE}

Complete the following steps in your Xcode project:

1. Drag the [!DNL AdobeMobileLibrary] folder into your project. 
1. Ensure that `ADBMobileConfig.json` is a member of your target. 
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Build Phases]** tab of your tvOS app’s target, expand the **[!UICONTROL Link Binary with Libraries]** section and add the following libraries:

   * `AdobeMobileLibrary_TV.a` 
   * `libsqlite3.0.tbd`
   * `SystemConfiguration.framework`

For information, see the iOS documentation on [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/ios/resources/).

## Configuring a TVML/TVJS App for tvOS {#section_AB2EC8C326654F3387658EBBD990BB12}

1. Drag the `AdobeMobileLibrary` folder into your project. 
1. Ensure that `ADBMobileConfig.json` is a member of your target. 
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Build Phases]** tab of your tvOS app’s target, expand the **[!UICONTROL Link Binary with Libraries]** section and add the following libraries:

    * `AdobeMobileLibrary_TV.a` 
    * `libsqlite3.0.tbd` 
    * `SystemConfiguration.framework`

1. In the implementation file of your `TVApplicationControllerDelegate` class, import the SDK.

   ```objective-c
   #import “ADBMobile.h"
   ```

1. In the `application:didFinishLaunchWithOptions:` method of your `TVApplicationControllerDelegate` class, pass your `TVApplicationController` object to the SDK with the `installTVMLHooks:` method.

   The Adobe SDK needs access to your app’s `TVApplicationController` to register itself into the JSContext of your app. This step allows you to call the native methods in the Adobe SDK from your JavaScript files.

   ```objective-c
   [ADBMobile installTVMLHooks:appController];
   ```

1. In your JavaScript files, use the `ADBMobile` object to access the native methods of the Adobe SDK.

   For a complete listing of the available methods, see [TVJS Methods](/help/ios/apple-tv-implementation-tvos/tvjs-methods.md).
