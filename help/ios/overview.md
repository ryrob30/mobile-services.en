## New Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK Release

Looking for information and documentation related to the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK? Click [here](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/) for our latest documentation.

>As of September 2018, we released a new, major version of the SDK. These new Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are configurable through [Experience Platform Launch](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html).

* To get started, go to Adobe Experience Platform Launch.
* To see what is in the Experience Platform SDK repositories, go to [Github: Adobe Experience Platform SDKs](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks).

Some information to remember:

* iOS 5 or later is supported

  For iOS 11 or later, you **must** have SDK version 4.13.8 or later. 

* In version 4.2 of this SDK and later, all hits are now sent using HTTP POST.

  This has no impact on the data that is collected or reported, but you need to use a packet analyzer that supports inspecting POST data to view hits.

* If you are upgrading from a previous version (2.x or 3.x), see the [4.x Migration Guide](/help/ios/getting-started/migration-v3.md).
